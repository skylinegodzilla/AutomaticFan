# AutomaticFan
 Automatic Arduino Lilypad Fan with adjustable Temperature
 By Ben Cawley
  
 Using:
 	
	USB Arduino Lilypad,
 
 	5V Fan,
 
 	DHT11 Sensor,
 
 	MotorDriver to controll the fan (I used a DRV8833 but you can use any one realey),
 
 	5V USB power supply,
 
 	2 Tactile Switchs,
 
 	2 10k ohm resistors.
  
 Code was written by Ben Cawley.
 Except for the DHT Sensor Library written by Adafruit.

  ToDo:
    When I get an Arduino with more pins I will add an LCD screen to display the Temp and Temp Settings so that the
    device wont need to be conected to the computer inorder to see the infomation.
    
If you want to try this project for yourself you will need to install the DHT Sensor Library from Adafruit 
that can be found here https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
